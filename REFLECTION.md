1. **DONE:** Downloaded the skeleton code.

2. **TODO:** Finish reading the project description.

3. **PROB:** Had a hard time scheduling physicial meetings with each other at
   first, but now that we've settled on a regular day/time things are looking
   great!

## TUE 2019-04-16 @ 11:55 PM EST

1. **DONE:** Downloaded the skeleton code, wrote base code for 2048, incuding   text objects for the title and score, added a button to that class, wrote some basic methods that will be used later, and wrote a Block class for the blocks in 2048. Also imported picture objects for the game.

2. **TODO:** Get the images to the tilepane, be able to move around, and detect collision working.

3. **PROB:** It is hard to schedule around events and classes, but we are working on it.
